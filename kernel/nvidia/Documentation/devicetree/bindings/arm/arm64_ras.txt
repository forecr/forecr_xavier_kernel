* ARMv8.2 RAS Driver
==============================

RAS are three aspects of the dependability of a system:
Reliability: continuity of correct service
Availability: readiness for correct service
Serviceability: ability to undergo modifications and repairs

ARMv8.2 provides RAS extensions to achieve the above features in a system.

arm64_ras driver allows you to handle Correctable errors using
Fault Handling Interrupt (or FHI).

The driver provides an API for CPU sepcific RAS drivers to
register callbacks in case of FHI. When FHI occurs, the FHI
ISR goes through the list of registered callbacks and executes
them.

Required Properties:

- compatible : Should be "arm,armv8.2-ras"
- interrupts : Represents the Fault Handling Interrupt

Example:
=========

	arm64_ras: arm64_ras {
		compatible = "arm,armv8.2ras";
		interrupts = <0 400 0x04>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
