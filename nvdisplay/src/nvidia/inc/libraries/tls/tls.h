/**
 * @defgroup Thread local storage operations
 *
 * @brief This module contains thread local storage functionality used by other
 * modules.
 *
 * @par Module dependencies:
 *   - NvPort (UTIL, ATOMIC, MEMORY, SYNC and THREAD modules)
 *   - NvContainers (Map)
 *   - NvUtils (NV_PRINTF and NV_ASSERT)
 *
 * @par TLS architecture:
 *   A base TLS allocation unit is an Entry (@ref TLS_ENTRY). Entries are local
 *   to a thread and are identified by a 64bit ID. Entries are lazy-allocated
 *   and refcounted. All entries for a given thread are organized in one Map -
 *   i.e. TLS has as many Maps active as there are threads; each map is
 *   inherently single-threaded. The Map for a given thread ID is obtained by
 *   searching a map of all threads with thread ID as key.
 *   The whole TLS system can be thought of as:
 *       map<thread_id, map<entry_id, void*>>
 *
 * @par Complexity:
 *   All operations are O(log(numActiveThreads) + log(numEntriesForGivenThread))
 *
 * @par A note on ISRs and DPCs
 *   Interrupt Service Routines (and in some cases Deferred Procedure Calls) do
 *   not have their own thread IDs - they can have the same ID as a regular
 *   thread. Because of this, they are kept in a separate map indexed by their
 *   stack pointer instead of thread ID. Because getting the exact base of the
 *   ISR stack can be difficult, when searching we use the closest one, in the
 *   direction of stack growth. This assumes that the given entry always exists,
 *   so ISR thread entries are preallocated with @ref tlsIsrInit.
 *
 *   An example of how this works:
 * ~~~{.c}
 *    if (is_isr())
 *        return isr_map.find(get_approx_sp());
 *    else
 *        return thread_map.find(get_thread_id());
 * ~~~
 *   The exact definition of is_isr() varies by platform, but generally means
 *   "if it does not have a unique thread ID". Threaded IRQs are not ISRs.
 *
 * @par Locking:
 *   Currently, TLS has two spinlocks - separate locks for ISR and passive
 *   thread maps. This will be changed to RW-spinlocks in the future.
 *   We cannot use RW sleeper locks in passive threads, since they may modify
 *   their IRQL and thus be unable to acquire them, even conditionally.
 *
 *   In cases where ISRs are not allowed to acquire a spinlock at all, the ISR
 *   map is implemented in a lockless fashion. This is slower than the locked
 *   implementation (O(maxIsrs)), but works in cases where all locks are banned.
 *
