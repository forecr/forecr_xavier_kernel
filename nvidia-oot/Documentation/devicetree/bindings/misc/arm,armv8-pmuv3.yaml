            Interrupts are give by a tuple of 3 values:
                - interrupt specifier (GIC_SPI = 0, GIC_PPI = 1)
                  definitions in dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/arm-gic.h
                - interrupt number
                - trigger type (rising edge, falling edge, both, etc)

            items:
