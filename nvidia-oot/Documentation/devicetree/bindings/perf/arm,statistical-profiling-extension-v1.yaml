description: |
     the compatability = arm,statistical-profiling-extension-v1 is mentioned in the following drivers
        - <TOP>/kernel/kernel-oot/drivers/perf/arm_spe_pmu.c

     The following nodes use this compatibility
        - /spe-pmu

select:
  properties:
    compatible:
        minItems: 1
        maxItems: 1
        items:
            enum:
                - arm,statistical-profiling-extension-v1

  required:
    - compatible

    interrupts:
        $ref: "/schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-matrix"

            Interrupts are give by a tuple of 3 values:
                - interrupt specifier (GIC_SPI = 0, GIC_PPI = 1)
                  definitions in dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/arm-gic.h
                - interrupt number
                - trigger type (rising edge, falling edge, both, etc)
                  definitions in dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h
        items:
            items:
                - $ref: "/schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32"
                  minimum: 0x1

                  maximum: 0x8

required:
    - compatible
    - interrupts

examples:
