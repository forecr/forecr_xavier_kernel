     the compatability = arm,armv8-timer is mentioned in the following drivers
        - <TOP>/kernel/kernel-oot/drivers/clocksource/arm_arch_timer.c

     The following nodes use this compatibility
        - /timer

            Interrupts are give by a tuple of 3 values:
                - interrupt specifier (GIC_SPI = 0, GIC_PPI = 1)
                  definitions in dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/arm-gic.h
                - interrupt number
                - trigger type (rising edge, falling edge, both, etc)
                  definitions in dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h
        items:
            items:
