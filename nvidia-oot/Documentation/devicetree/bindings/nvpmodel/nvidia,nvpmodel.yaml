description: |
     the compatability = nvidia,nvpmodel is mentioned in the following drivers
        - <TOP>/kernel/nvidia-oot/drivers/nvpmodel/nvpmodel-clk-cap.c

     The following nodes use this compatibility
        - /nvpmodel

        minItems: 1
        maxItems: 1
        items:
            enum:
                - nvidia,nvpmodel

  required:
    - compatible

            Clocks are given by a tuple of 2 values:
                - Phandle to the device
                - Clock ID
