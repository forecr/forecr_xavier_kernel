title: NVIDIA nvpmodel driver for emc clock cap

maintainers:
  - Johnny Liu <johnliu@nvidia.com>

description: |
  Nvpmodel is a driver that provides sysfs nodes that allow capping certain clock
  frequencies in order to keep the power consumption under a certain budget.

  These caps are designed to be relatively static. They should not be used
  during runtime (under load) to dynamically change the power budget

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - nvidia,nvpmodel-emc-cap

required:
  - compatible

examples:
  - |
    nvpmodel: {
      compatible = "nvidia,nvpmodel-emc-cap";
      status = "okay";
    };
...
